# STM32 ARM Programming Labs

This repository contains a series of labs focused on learning ARM STM32 programming. The projects involve working with a 7-segment display and performing various tasks using STM32 microcontrollers.

## Lab Overview

### 1. Lab1 - 7-Segment Indicator
   - **Description**: This lab covers the basics of using a 7-segment indicator with STM32. The focus is on displaying static digits on the 7-segment display.
   - **Objective**: Learn how to interface a 7-segment display with the STM32 microcontroller.

### 2. Lab2 - 7-Segment Indicator Counter
   - **Description**: In this lab, we extend the functionality of the 7-segment indicator to build a counter. The counter increments the displayed value over time.
   - **Objective**: Implement a simple up-counter using STM32 and a 7-segment display.

### 3. Lab3 - 7-Segment Indicator with Button Manipulation
   - **Description**: This lab introduces interaction with buttons to manipulate the 7-segment display. The buttons allow the user to increment, decrement, and shift digits on the display.
   - **Objective**: Learn how to handle button inputs and modify the 7-segment display output in real-time.
   - **Features**:
     - Increment and decrement the value.
     - Shift digits on the 7-segment display.

### 4. Lab4 - Modbus Communication
   - **Description**: This lab introduces the Modbus communication protocol. The project implements Modbus communication between devices using STM32.
   - **Objective**: Understand and implement Modbus protocol on STM32 for data exchange between master and slave devices.

## Tools and Environment
- **Microcontroller**: STM32
- **Development Environment**: STM32CubeIDE or any preferred ARM development toolchain
- **Language**: C
